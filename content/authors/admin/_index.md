I am a PhD student at the University of Minnesota in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. 
My research focuses on using computational and mathematical tools in order to understand the dynamics of soft matter systems.
Right now I am developing tools to simulate the dynamics of topological defects in liquid crystals, considering the coupling between Landau-de Gennes field theory and induced hydrodynamic flows.
